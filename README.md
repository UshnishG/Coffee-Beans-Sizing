invert.py -> Inverts the image background to black and the beans to white with proper edge detection

contourinv.py -> Detects the contour of the beans, loops through each contour, defines the minimum area rectangle and hence finds the width of the beans.

test images are uploaded

and we have tested it out with test7.png --> running it through invert.py , we get results_with_contours7.png --> and running that through contourinv.py, we get results_with_annotations7.png
